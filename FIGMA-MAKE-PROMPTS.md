### Screen 16: Intelligence — Ellie Tab

> Create a desktop web page (1280×900) with dark background #0A0A0A.
>
> **Header & Tab bar:** Same structure, **Ellie** tab active (orange underline).
>
> **Layout:** This tab is a chat interface, not a dashboard grid. Full-height centered column (max-width 720px).
>
> **Chat thread — alternating message bubbles:**
>
> 1. **ELLIE** (gold label, uppercase, small) — dark bubble (#1A1A1A, border #333, left-aligned, rounded 16px):
> "Hey! I've been analyzing Design Circle SF all week. A few things jumped out — your engagement dipped 12% since last Tuesday, but your event RSVPs are actually up 18%. Want me to dig into what's happening?"
>
> Below this message, two embedded data cards side by side:
> - **Trend card** (small, dark): "Engagement" label + mini line chart showing a dip + "−12%" in red
> - **Trend card** (small, dark): "Event RSVPs" label + mini line chart showing upward trend + "+18%" in green
>
> 2. **YOU** (grey label) — cream/light bubble (#F5EDE0, dark text, right-aligned):
> "Yeah, dig in. What's causing the engagement drop?"
>
> 3. **ELLIE** — dark bubble:
> "Looks like your most active members — Sarah, Mike, and Priya — all went quiet around the same time. They usually drive 40% of weekly posts. Sarah was last active 8 days ago. Could be worth a personal check-in."
>
> Below this message, an embedded **Member card** (dark, border #333):
> 3 member rows: avatar (initials) → name → "Last active X days ago" → risk score bar (red/amber)
>
> 4. **YOU** — cream bubble:
> "What should I do?"
>
> 5. **ELLIE** — dark bubble:
> "I'd suggest three things: (1) Send Sarah and Mike a personal DM — I can draft those for you. (2) Your next event is in 5 days — create a hype post tagging your most active members. (3) Run a quick poll asking what content people want this month. Want me to set any of those up?"
>
> **Below the chat thread — Suggested Questions section:**
> Label: "SUGGESTED QUESTIONS" in grey uppercase, small.
> A 2×3 grid of question cards (dark #1A1A1A, border #333, rounded):
> - ❤️ "Who are my most at-risk members?"
> - 📈 "What content gets the most engagement?"
> - 👥 "How does my community compare to others?"
> - 📅 "When should I schedule my next event?"
> - 📊 "What are the trending topics this week?"
> - 🤖 "Draft a welcome message for new members"
>
> **Bottom input bar:** Dark input field spanning full width: placeholder "Ask Ellie anything about your community..." with cream send button on right.
