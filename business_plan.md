# Central Square - Project Summary

## Vision
Central Square is building the community marketplace - a new social layer of the internet where communities thrive, discover each other, and create economic opportunities without algorithmic manipulation or ads.

## The Core Problem We're Solving
- **Connection crisis**: People are lonelier than ever despite being "connected" on social media
- **Platform failure**: Current platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Discord) optimize for attention and engagement, not genuine belonging
- **Community builder burnout**: Organizers juggle fragmented tools (WhatsApp + Discord + Notion + Eventbrite + Stripe) with no ownership, sustainability, or economic support
- **Missing infrastructure**: Communities exist and are flourishing (87% of companies now have community programs, run clubs growing 40% YoY), but their digital infrastructure is broken

## What We're Building

### Product Architecture
**Two interconnected layers:**

1. **The Square** - Public discovery layer
   - Cross-community visibility without algorithmic feeds
   - Discover communities by genuine interest and intent, not engagement metrics
   - Serendipitous connections between different communities

2. **The Arcades** - Community homes
   - Purpose-driven spaces where communities actually live
   - Professional infrastructure (discussions, events, members, archives)
   - White-labeled feel with community identity
   - Tools for community operators to manage and grow

### Business Model (Three Revenue Streams)
1. **Communities Pay** ($50-500/month)
   - Professional infrastructure replacing fragmented tools
   - Access to sponsorship marketplace
   - Member management, events, analytics

2. **Enterprises Pay** ($5K-30K/month)
   - Host large communities (Adobe: 2.4M members, 214 communities)
   - Cross-community discovery
   - Sponsor authentic communities on the platform

3. **Marketplace Revenue** (15-20% of sponsorships)
   - Adobe sponsors design communities, run clubs, creator groups
   - Communities receive 80-85%, we facilitate and take fee
   - No ads, no engagement manipulation

**Example Economics:**
Design community pays $200/month → receives $5,000/year in Adobe sponsorships → **net gain $2,600/year** + professional tools

## Target Users

### Primary: B2B2C Model

**Year 1 Focus:**
- **Enterprise customers**: Adobe, Microsoft, Aspen Institute (organizations with existing communities)
- **SMB/Institutions**: Mid-size SaaS companies, universities, foundations
- **Professional operators**: Serious community builders (creator networks, industry associations, multi-chapter organizations)

**NOT targeting (initially):**
- Free hobbyist communities
- Individual casual organizers
- Run clubs (too grassroots - mentioned as example but not primary ICP)

### The Persona Evolution
While "Charlie the community builder" was our initial thinking, we've evolved to:
- **Sarah, Head of Community at Adobe** (enterprise customer)
- **Design community founder** with 5K members monetizing their expertise
- **Professional network operators** running paid membership communities

## Differentiation

**We are NOT:**
- Another Discord/Slack clone
- A protocol or SDK
- Creator platform dependency (Patreon, Substack model)
- Community software for enterprises only (Khoros, Higher Logic)

**We ARE:**
- Community-first infrastructure with economic opportunity built in
- B2B2C marketplace model (start with orgs, become community layer)
- Modern UX meeting professional needs
- Sponsorship marketplace as core feature, not add-on

**Competitive positioning:**
- **vs Discord/Slack**: Professional infrastructure, economic opportunity
- **vs Circle/Mighty Networks**: Enterprise-grade + true marketplace
- **vs Khoros/Higher Logic**: Modern UX, cross-community discovery, sponsorships
- **vs Twitter/Instagram**: Community-focused, not individual creator-focused

## User Experience (Inspired by 222 Onboarding)

### Onboarding Flow

**Opening Experience:**
Clean, minimal, human-feeling (NOT corporate software)

**Step 1: Intent Discovery**
"What brings you here?"
- Conversational AI interface (voice or text)
- Understands context: "I'm a designer looking for community" vs "I run a design community"
- Natural language, not forms

**Step 2: Identity & Rhythm**
"Tell me about your life"
- What do you create/build?
- What times of day are you most engaged?
- What makes you feel alive?

**Step 3: Community Matching**
Based on conversation, show matched communities:
- Visual cards showing community vibe, not just stats
- "Design communities" → Adobe Creative Cloud community, local designer meetups, etc.
- Match score explained transparently

**For Community Builders:**
- "Do you run a community?" → Arcade creation flow
- Professional setup (not overwhelming)
- Walk through: identity, purpose, membership structure
- Preview what sponsors might be interested

### Core User Journeys

### Design Principles (Inspired by Your Aesthetic)

- Subtle network motifs (nodes, connections)

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Constellation/network patterns (communities as stars forming patterns)
- Warm accent colors for actions and highlights
- Typography: Serif for personality, sans-serif for clarity
- Generous white space
- Subtle animations for transitions

## Technical Considerations for Claude

When helping with Central Square:

**Prioritize:**
- Community-first language (not "users" - "members" or "people")
- B2B2C positioning (not B2C social network)
- Marketplace economics (sponsorships as infrastructure, not ads)
- Professional tone but human warmth
- SF Bay Area context (hiring, salaries, market)

**Remember:**
- We're NOT building for run clubs (example only, not ICP)
- We're NOT a protocol/SDK
- Design communities are our best example customer
- Adobe is anchor enterprise customer
- $3M raise is for 24 months, not 18

**Design aesthetic:**
- Minimalist black background with grid
- Warm amber/orange accents
- Serif headlines, sans-serif body
- Generous spacing
- Network/constellation visual metaphors

**Key locked decisions:**
- Serve community builders first (B2B2C, not B2C)
- Arcades are the core unit
- Sponsorships = infrastructure revenue
- Angel funding only initially
- SF Bay Area based
- 24-month runway to Series A

## Questions to Help You Help Me

1. **Product Development**: Building features for Arcades, The Square, or onboarding flows
2. **Fundraising**: Pitch decks, investor materials, financial models
3. **Go-to-Market**: Enterprise sales strategy, pilot customer success
4. **Content**: Website copy, marketing materials, thought leadership
5. **Operations**: Hiring plans, team structure, milestone planning

When in doubt, ask: "Is this solving for the community builder or the community member?" Both matter, but community builders pay the bills.
